## Project Objective :
Create a model to predict house prices in Ames, Lowa, USA, using a machine learning model

## Business Understanding :
1.The real estate industry is one of the industries with
unpredictable price movements. Therefore, a system is needed to provide price recommendations based on certain criteria and data.
2.It is important to determine the price of a house using a system because currently, the price is usually determined using only traditional methods that are not based on comprehensive data.
3.Machine learning with the regression method is needed because the dependent variable, namely the house price, is continuous and not categorical data.
